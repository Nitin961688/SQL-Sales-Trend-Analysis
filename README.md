# SQL Sales Trend Analysis — Data Analyst Internship Task
## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains SQL scripts and a sample dataset for analyzing sales trends as part of a Data Analyst Internship assignment.
The focus is on using aggregations, grouping, and window functions in SQL to explore patterns in monthly revenue, order volume, regional sales, and customer behavior.

## 🗂️ Dataset

A synthetic dataset online_sales_dataset.csv was generated with 500 rows of e-commerce transactions.

Columns:

order_id → Unique identifier for each order

order_date → Date of the order

customer_id → Unique customer identifier

product_id → Unique product identifier

category → Product category (Electronics, Clothing, Books, etc.)

quantity → Units ordered

price → Price per unit

amount → Total order value (quantity * price)

payment_method → Mode of payment (Credit Card, PayPal, UPI, etc.)

region → Region of the order (North, South, East, West)

## 🚀 Outcome

By completing this project, we learned:

How to use GROUP BY for time-based and categorical aggregations

How to calculate monthly revenue, order volume, and customer trends

How to apply window functions for cumulative totals and comparisons

How to generate insights for business decision-making
